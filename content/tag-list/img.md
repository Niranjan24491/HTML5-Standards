<h3>Standard Definition</h3>
The img (short for image) tag defines an image in an HTML document. Images are not directly inserted into the document; they are linked to the HTML pages. The img element creates a holding space to embed the referenced image designated by the src attribute.

<h3>Need for this tag</h3>
This tag is needed when we need to include an image on the web page. The image path is included in the src attribute of img tag with alternate image text in alt tag.

<h3>Disadvantage of this tag</h3>
<ol>
  <li>using IMG tag instead of background image reduce the performance of the web page.</li>
  <li>using IMG tag we can not make the image stationary while the content scrolls.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Advantages of this tag</h3>
<ol>
  <li>By default, browsers are not always set to print background image, so using img tag is beneficial.</li>
  <li>By using img instead of backgrounds you can add for example alt attribute to your image. It makes your SEO better and provides an alternative solution to show if your image isn't available.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Working Example</h3>

    <img src="kites.jpg" alt="Flying Kites">
    <img src="sky.jpg" alt="Cloudy Sky">
    <img src="ballons.jpg" alt="Hot Air Ballons">
