The HTML <span class='tag-span'>&lt;a&gt;</span> tag is used for creating a hyperlink to another web page or to a different section of the same page.

<h3>Need for this tag</h3>
The anchor tag is essentially a tag that you can attach to a phrase (exactly like you would a internal or external link), except it brings readers down to a different section of the page as opposed to another webpage. Youâ€™re essentially creating a unique URL within the same page when you use this tag.

{{% notice tip %}}
  You can use the target attribute of anchor tag to specify whether to open the web page in a new browser window or not.
{{% /notice %}}

<h3>Disadvantages of this tag</h3>
  <ol>
    <li> In HTML5, the <span class='tag-span'>&lt;a&gt;</span> tag is always a hyperlink, but if it has no href attribute, it is only a placeholder for a hyperlink.</li>
  </ol>

<h3>Advantages of this tag</h3>
<ol>
  <li><u>No Scrolling</u>: The biggest benefit to the anchor tag is not forcing your visitors to scroll down tons of information to find a particular section. This can get daunting, and depending on just how much content is on the page, it can be very difficult to find a certain section amidst all the content.</li>

  <li><u>Organization</u>: This helps webmasters keep things in order. Instead of having to create several different webpages or splitting up a document, you can keep it all in one place.</li>

  <li><u>Search Engine Use</u>: Google sometimes uses this tag to help send a user to a specific section of your webpage, which helps make things easier for users.</li>
</ol>
