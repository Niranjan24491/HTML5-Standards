<h3>Standard Definition</h3>
The HTML Keyboard Input Element (<kbd>) represents user input and produces an inline element displayed in the browser's default monospace font.

<h3>Need for this tag</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Supported ads: The tag works for any ads that use iframe/JavaScript or JavaScript tags. DCM will only generate the ins tag for ads on supported placements, so you don't have to worry whether your placement is supported.</li>
  <li>Tag format: The tag uses HTML attributes rather than URL parameters. When the tag fires on your site, the HTML attributes will change into the corresponding parameters in the tag and then return the requested content.</li>
  <li>Browser support: If the rendering mode is set to iframe, then the browser must support both iframes and JavaScript for the ad to load. If the rendering mode is set to JavaScript, then the browser only needs to support JavaScript. The browser must always support JavaScript for these tags because there is no noscript portion of the tag.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Advantages of this tag</h3>
<ol>
  <li>For advertisers: This tag provides richer domain information in DCM Verification, giving you greater visibility into where your ads are serving, as well as better facilitating brand safety and spam protection.</li>
  <li>For publishers: Thereâ€™s no need to add cache busters (ord=) to this tag, allowing for easier tag implementation.</li>
</ol>
