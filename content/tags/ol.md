<p>The HTML <span class='tag-span'>&lt;ol&gt;</span> element (or HTML Ordered List Element) represents an ordered list of items. Typically, ordered-list items are displayed with a preceding numbering, which can be of any form, like numerals, letters or Romans numerals or even simple bullets. This numbered style is not defined in the HTML description of the page, but in its associated CSS, using the list-style-type property.

<h3>Need for this tag</h3>

<p>Specifying lists of information in which the items are intentionally ordered, such that changing the order would change the meaning of the list.</p>

<h3>Advantages of this tag</h3>

<p>It provides semantic correctness. HTML has the ability to express lists of things, and it helps the Google robot, screen readers to identify that the information is a list, and not just "something" that is some text inside an arbitrary element.</p>

<h3>Working Example</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>First item</li>
      <li>Second item</li>
      <li>Third item</li>
    </ol>

<h3>Difference between <span class='tag-span'>&lt;ol&gt;</span> and <span class='tag-span'> &lt;ul&gt;</span></h3>

<p> The <span class='tag-span'>&lt;ol&gt;</span> and <span class='tag-span'>&lt;ul&gt;</span> elements both represent a list of items. They differ in that, with the <span class='tag-span'> &lt;ol&gt;</span> element, the order is meaningful. As a rule of thumb to determine which one to use, try changing the order of the list items; if the meaning is changed, the <span class='tag-span'> &lt;ol&gt;</span> element should be used, otherwise you can use <span class='tag-span'>&lt;ul&gt;</span>.</p>
