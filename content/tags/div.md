The HTML <code>div</code> (short for division) tag is generic container for flow content, which has no default rendering or meaning. The tag is extensively used to define the structural sections of a document and to layout a web page using CSS. With the <div> tag, you can group large sections of HTML elements together and format them with CSS.

<h3>Need for this tag</h3>
Pages have parts – sections that serve particular functions – and as a rule those parts have been set with div tags. On the top of most pages is a header. Likewise most pages have a nav div and on the bottom a footer. These are divs that tend stay the same throughout a website. Then there are divs (or a div) with content that is unique to each page.

<h3>Advantages of this tag</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Properly structuring our DOM (Document Object Model)</li>
  <li>It is a container in which you create a division of your documents and you can manipulate your document layout using class and id names in the div tag.</li>
  <li>A div is a block element. This means that if you use a div, unless  you float objects next to it using CSS, the div will be alone on a line.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Disadvantage of this tag</h3>
The most obvious disadvantage of the DIV tag is the fact that it doesn't aid in adding semantics to the page. The DIV tag is a generic holder of content. As such, a parser has no understanding of why that content is being pulled out and place in its own container.

<h3>Working Example</h3>

    <div class="welcome-box">
      <h1>Welcome</h1>
      <p>Hi, welcome to our website.</p>
    </div>
