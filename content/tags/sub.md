<h3>Standard Definition</h3>
    The HTML <sub> element defines a span of text that should be displayed, for typographic reasons, lower, and often smaller, than the main span of text.

<h3>Need for this tag</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This element should be used for typographical reasons only, i.e. changing the position of the text changing its meaning like in mathematical (like t2, though the use of a MathML formula should be considered) or chemical formulas (like H2O).</li>
  <li>This element must not be used for styling purpose like the styling of the product name Latex. In that case CSS style should be used: the vertical-align property with the sub value will achieve the same effect.</li>
</ul>
