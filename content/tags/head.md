<h3>Standard Definition</h3>
The HTML head element provides general information (metadata) about the document, including its title and links to its scripts and style sheets.

<h3>Need for this tag</h3>
This tag is used to indicate the head section of HTML document. The head can contain other HTML tags that provide information about the document such as title, description, keywords etc. You will often see the title tag, meta tag, the script tag, and the style tag in the head of a typical HTML document. Most of this information is not displayed in the browser (although the title usually appears in the browser's title bar) but can be useful for the functionality of the page. The head tag is placed between the opening and closing html /html tags.

<h3>Advantages of this tag</h3>
<ol>
  <li>head usually contains your title, which defines the title of your webpage; </li>
  <li>base, which specifies base URL/target for all relative URLs in that webpage; </li>
  <li>link, which specifies a relation between internal and external resources, like stylesheets and favicons;</li>
  <li>style, defines CSS style information; </li>
  <li>meta, which simply provides data to the browser or robots;</li>
  <li>script (or noscript), used to define a client-side script, such as JavaScript (programming language).</li>
</ol>

<h3>Working Example</h3>

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title><!--Document title--></title>
      </head>
      <body>
