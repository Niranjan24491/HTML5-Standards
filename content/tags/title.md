The HTML <span class='tag-span'>&lt;title&gt;</span> element describes the topic and theme of an online document, shown in a browser's title bar or on the page's tab. It can only contain text, and any contained tags are ignored.

<h3>Need for this tag</h3>

The title tag is the boldest, most obvious element in a search result and therefore a major part in the decision making process of whether a searcher will click on your result or not. If you omit the <span class='tag-span'>&lt;title&gt;</span> tag, the document will not validate as HTML.

<h3>Disadvantages of this tag</h3>

Sometimes if Google doesn’t like your title tag it will rewrite it for its search engine results, pulling in information from your meta description and page content. Chances are this won’t be as good as the one you’ve created.

{{% notice note %}}
  You must ensure that your own title tag is completely relevant, descriptive, keyword rich but readable and the right length.
{{% /notice %}}
