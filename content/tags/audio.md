The HTML <audio> element is used to embed sound content in documents. It may contain one or more audio sources, represented using the src attribute or the <source> element; the browser will choose the most suitable one

<h3>Need for this tag</h3>
Fallback content for browsers not supporting the <audio> element can be added too, inside the opening and closing <audio></audio> tags.

The most basic playback functionality can be made available using the controls attribute (see below); for more advanced usage, audio playback and controls can be manipulated using the HTML Media API, and more specifically the features defined in the HTMLAudioElement interface.

  * The autoplay attribute has precedence over preload. If autoplay is specified, the browser would obviously need to start downloading the audio for playback.
  * The browser is not forced by the specification to follow the value of this attribute; it is a mere hint.
