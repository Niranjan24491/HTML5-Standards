The HTML figure element represents self-contained content, frequently with a caption (figcaption), and is typically referenced as a single unit. While it is related to the main flow, its position is independent of the main flow. Usually this is an image, an illustration, a diagram, a code snippet, or a schema that is referenced in the main text, but that can be moved to another page or to an appendix without affecting the main flow.

<h3>Need for this tag</h3>
FIGURE Element is used to put an image into a web page with semantics. it act as a container for the images. As per HTML5 standards we should use this element to add any image into a web page.

<h3>Disadvantage of this tag</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Older browsers (such as IE8 and below) will need JavaScript-based polyfills and basic CSS to make the elements behave as intended</li>
</ol>

<h3>Advantages of this tag</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.</li>
  <li>The content of the figure element is however related to the main flow, but its position is independent of the main flow and it can be moved away from the main flow of the document without affecting the document's meaning.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Working Example</h3>
