The HTML <span class='tag-span'>&lt;comment&gt;</span> element is used for creating comments within your HTML code. Comments aren't displayed in the browser - they are simply there for the programmer's benefit. Comments can assist you, the HTML programmer, because you can write notes to yourself that explain what the code does. This is especially useful when you have a lot of code.

<h3>Need for this tag</h3>
Technically, the <span class='tag-span'>&lt;comment&gt;</span> element is not actually a 'tag'. It is simply a means to provide developers with a way to comment their code without it being rendered on the page. Therefore, there are no attributes available for the comments tag.

<h3>Advantages of this tag</h3>
<ul>
  <li><span class='tag-span'>&lt;comment&gt;</span> element helps in making the code readable.</li>
  <li><span class='tag-span'>&lt;comment&gt;</span> element helps in maintaining the code by explaining each complex code snippets.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Working Example</h3>

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
    <title>HTML <!--....--> Tag</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    <comment>This is a commented line in IE</comment>
    <!-- This is a commented line supported by almost every browser. It will not appear in output as its a comment. -->
    </body>
    </html>
