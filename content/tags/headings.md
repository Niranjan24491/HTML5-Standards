<h3>Standard Definition</h3>
Heading elements implement six levels of document headings, h1 is the most important and h6 is the least. A heading element briefly describes the topic of the section it introduces. Heading information may be used by user agents, for example, to construct a table of contents for a document automatically.

<h3>Need for this tag</h3>
The H1 tag is the most important heading because it’s the highest level tag that shows what your specific page is about. Search engines generally give this tag more weight over other headings, so it usually improves your search engine ranking when you use it correctly and in conjunction with other onsite SEO techniques.
<br>
h2 - h6  are not as important to the search engines as your H1 tag. Unlike the H1 tag, you may have multiple H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6 sub-headings. Think of these sub-headings as ways of organizing the content on your page for your readers more than for the search engines. These headings should also contain important keywords and help organize your content into sections, so readers can scan your page and decide if it’s something they’re interested in reading.

<h3>Advantages of this tag</h3>
<ol>
  <li><h5>Accessibility & Usability</h5>
      Headings increase a page’s usability by making the it more “scannable.” Nobody reads pages from top to bottom. Instead, one’s eyes flow down the page looking for relevant keywords to explore more closely. By breaking a page up with headings, a user can scan the page faster and more effectively.

      Headings also allow scanning of the page by anyone using a screen reader to hear the page’s content. With headings, a screen reader can read the page’s “table of contents” as implied by the heading structure (like the above list), and the user can jump directly to the desired section.</li>
  <li><h5>Visual Consistency</h5>
      With a web technology called CSS, web designers can define the style of each heading (e.g. all heading 1s, all heading 2s, etc.) so they look the same on each page. Doing this saves site editors and users time
  </li>
  <li><h5>Search Engine Friendly</h5>
  Search engines use headings as an indicator of what text is most important on a page. Given two otherwise identical pages, the one using headings should appear above the one that doesn’t in search results.

  Each lower level of heading has less “weight” with search results, so a keyword appearing in a heading 1 influences search engines more than the same word in a heading 2.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Working Example</h3>

    <h1>Heading level 1</h1>
    <h2>Heading level 2</h2>
    <h3>Heading level 3</h3>
    <h4>Heading level 4</h4>
    <h5>Heading level 5</h5>
    <h6>Heading level 6</h6>
