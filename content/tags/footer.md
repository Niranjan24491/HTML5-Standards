<h3>Standard Definition</h3>
The HTML footer element represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element. A footer typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents.

<h3>Need for this tag</h3>
<ol>
<li>HTML5 Elements such as article, header, footer, main, aside and many more are used for semantics - to add meaning to your code. It's easier for a person to read and edit the code when you know that the element is used as a footer for example.</li>

<li>footer, article, header and other new html5 tags are there to help you structure your page in a more comprehensive and natural way. It will be a lot more easier to handle when you will use CSS code to format it. You can, of course, use div tags with id or class attributes instead but your code will be clearer with those new tags. I guess it might also be useful for Search Engines that analyzes the content of your pages.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Advantages of this tag</h3>
<ol>
  <li>The main advantage is while loading your code the web browser knows the footer portion. It helps in prioritizing on the things to be loaded first and which has to be loaded later.</li>
  <li>it is easy to see which parts of the page are headers, nav, footers, aside, etc as the tags are specific for these all and most importantly know what their meaning and purpose is in whole the format.</li>
</ol>
