The HTML Code Element (<code>) represents a fragment of computer code. By default, it is displayed in the browser's default monospace font.

<h3>Need for this tag</h3>
The code element represents a fragment of computer code. This could be an XML element name, a file name, a computer program, or any other string that a computer would recognize.

There is no formal way to indicate the language of computer code being marked up. Authors who wish to mark code elements with the language used, e.g. so that syntax highlighting scripts can use the right rules, can use the class attribute, e.g. by adding a class prefixed with "language-" to the element.

<h3>Working Example</h3>

    <p>Regular text. <code>This is code.</code> Regular text.</p>
