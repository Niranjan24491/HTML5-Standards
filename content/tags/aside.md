The HTML <aside> element represents a section of the page with content connected tangentially to the rest, which could be considered separate from that content.

<h3>Need for this tag</h3>
These sections are often represented as sidebars or inserts. They often contain the definitions on the sidebars, such as definitions from the glossary; there may also be other types of information, such as related advertisements.

<h3>Disadvantages of this tag</h3>
<ul>
  <li>It's not appropriate to use the aside element just for parentheticals, since those are part of the main flow of the document.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advantages of this tag</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Will help in Search Engine Optimization(SEO) by following the HTML standards</li>
  <li>Provides semantic meaning to the HTML page</li>
</ol>
